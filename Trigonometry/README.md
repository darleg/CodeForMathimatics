Trigonometry is a fascinating branch of mathematics that focuses on the 
relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, especially 
right-angled triangles. Here's a brief overview:
- Angles and Sides: In a right triangle, trigonometry helps us understand how the angles 
  relate to the lengths of the sides. The three main functions in trigonometry are sine (sin), 
  cosine (cos), and tangent (tan), which are ratios of different sides of the triangle.
