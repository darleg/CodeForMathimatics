In geometry we learn about lines and angles that are fundamental concepts that are used for understanding shapes. We also learn about kinds of triangles in which one of them is a right-angled triangle.

With the Pythagorean theorem is used to calculate the hypotenuse a² + b² = c².


Trigonometry is a fascinating branch of mathematics that focuses on the 
relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, especially right-angled triangles. Here's a brief overview:

- Angles and Sides: In a right triangle, trigonometry helps us understand how the angles 
  relate to the lengths of the sides. The three main functions in trigonometry are sine (sin),
  cosine (cos), and tangent (tan), which are ratios of different sides of the triangle.

- Sine (sin): This function relates the angle to the ratio of the length of the opposite side 
  to the hypotenuse.

  $\large \sin \theta = \frac{Opposite}{Hypotenuse}$
  
- Cosine (cos): This function relates the angle to the ratio of the length of the adjacent 
  side to the hypotenuse.

  $\large \cos \theta = \frac{Adjacent}{Hypotenuse}$
  
- Tangent (tan): This function relates the angle to the ratio of the length of the opposite 
  side to the adjacent side.

  $\large \tan \theta = \frac{Opposite}{Adjacent}$
  
Unit Circle Formula in Trigonometry

- The general equation of circle is given below:
$\large \left(x-h\right)^{2}+\left(y-k\right)^{2}=r^{2}$

- The unit circle formula is:
$\large x^2 + y^2 = 1$

The ratios of trigonometry are given by:

- $\large \sin \theta = \frac{y}{1} = y$

- $\large \cos \theta = \frac{x}{1} = x$

- $\large \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{y}{x}$

- $\large \cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} = \frac{x}{y}$

- $\large \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1}{x}$

- $\large \csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{1}{y}$





Trigonometry isn't just limited to theoretical math; it's widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, astronomy, and even in computer graphics. It's a critical tool for understanding waves, oscillations, and many other natural phenomena.
