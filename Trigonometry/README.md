Trigonometry is a fascinating branch of mathematics that focuses on the 
relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, especially 
right-angled triangles. Here's a brief overview:
- Angles and Sides: In a right triangle, trigonometry helps us understand how the angles 
  relate to the lengths of the sides. The three main functions in trigonometry are sine (sin), 
  cosine (cos), and tangent (tan), which are ratios of different sides of the triangle.
- Sine (sin): This function relates the angle to the ratio of the length of the opposite side 
  to the hypotenuse.
- Cosine (cos): This function relates the angle to the ratio of the length of the adjacent 
  side to the hypotenuse.
