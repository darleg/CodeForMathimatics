Basic mathematical concepts that are fundamental to understanding more advanced topics.
1. Numbers and Operations
-  Integers: Whole numbers positive or negative, including zero (e.g., -2, 0, 3).
-  Fractions: Numbers expressed as the ratio of two integers (e.g., 1/2, 3/4).
-  Decimals: Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., 0.5, 3.14).
2. Arithmetic Operations
-  Addition (+): Combining two numbers to get a sum.
-  Subtraction (-): Finding the difference between two numbers.
-  Multiplication (ร): Repeated addition of a number.
-  Division (รท): Splitting a number into equal parts.
3. Algebra
-  Variables: Symbols (often letters) that represent numbers (e.g., x, y).
-  Expressions: Combinations of numbers, variables, and operations (e.g., 2x + 5).
-  Equations: Statements that two expressions are equal (e.g., 2x + 5 = 11).

4. Geometry
-  Points: Exact locations in space.
-  Lines: Straight paths extending infinitely in both directions.
-  Angles: Formed by two rays with a common endpoint, measured in degrees.
-  Shapes: Two-dimensional figures (e.g., triangles, squares, circles).
