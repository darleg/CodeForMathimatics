Basic mathematical concepts that are fundamental to understanding more advanced topics.
1. Numbers and Operations
-  Integers: Whole numbers positive or negative, including zero (e.g., -2, 0, 3).
-  Decimals: Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., 0.5, 3.14).
-  Complex:
-  Fractions: Numbers expressed as the ratio of two integers (e.g., 1/2, 3/4).
2. Arithmetic Operations
-  Addition (+): Combining two numbers to get a sum.
-  Subtraction (-): Finding the difference between two numbers.
-  Multiplication (ร): Repeated addition of a number.
-  Division (รท): Splitting a number into equal parts.
3. Algebra
-  Variables: Symbols (often letters) that represent numbers (e.g., x, y).
-  Expressions: Combinations of numbers, variables, and operations (e.g., 2x + 5).
-  Equations: Statements that two expressions are equal (e.g., 2x + 5 = 11).
4. Geometry
-  Points: Exact locations in space.
-  Lines: Straight paths extending infinitely in both directions.
-  Angles: Formed by two rays with a common endpoint, measured in degrees.
-  Shapes: Two-dimensional figures (e.g., triangles, squares, circles).
5. Trigonometry
-  Sine, Cosine, Tangent: Ratios of the sides of a right triangle relative to an angle.
-  Unit Circle: A circle with a radius of one centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.
6. Calculus
-  Derivatives: Measure of how a function changes as its input changes.
-  Integrals: Measure of the total accumulation of quantities.
7. Statistics
-  Mean: Average of a set of numbers.
-  Median: Middle value in a set of numbers.
-  Mode: Most frequently occurring value in a set.
-  Standard Deviation: Measure of the spread of a set of numbers.
8. Probability
-  Probability: Measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, between 0 and 1.
-  Random Variables: Variables whose values depend on the outcomes of random phenomena.
-  Distributions: Descriptions of the probabilities of different outcomes (e.g., normal 
   distribution).

These concepts form the foundation of mathematics and are crucial for understanding more complex topics.
