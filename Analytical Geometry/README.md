# Plotting Mathimatic Functions

Back in high school I use to draw beautiful plots on graphic paper.
Well, to me they looked cool. After multiple advance math classes
my graphing did not look so good. So, several years later I was taking
some refresher courses. Knowing that I did not have it in me to draw those
beautiful plots anymore because I had access to plotters and minicomputers
at work. So, I wrote Fortran program to graph my homework on 8x11 sheet of
paper. It did 6 to 8 graphs per sheet. Also. same program with basic. This was
done before the PC came out. Most student would not have access to such
equipment.  I was not sure how the instructor would take this, but I gave it a go.
He said “There is one in every class, a smart a—“, but he liked my program and
showed it to the class. Latter I did some other plots for him. About two years later
I went up to the math department to get some advice and saw that some of my
programs made it to the hall of fame as good example of what could be done.
So now that I have been programming in python for a while I will see
If  I can do something similar with python.
