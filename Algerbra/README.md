Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. These symbols represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. At its core, algebra involves:
1. Variables: Symbols that represent unknown values or quantities.
2. Expressions: Combinations of variables, numbers, and arithmetic operations.
3. Equations: Mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions.
4. Functions: Relationships between sets of inputs and outputs, often written as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$.
5. Solving Equations: Finding the values of variables that make an equation true.
Algebra is used in various fields, from science and engineering to economics and everyday problem-solving. It's a foundational tool that helps us understand and describe patterns, relationships, and changes in the world around us.
