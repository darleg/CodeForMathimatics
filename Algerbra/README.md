Algebra
Algebra is a broad branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. The symbols represent quantities without fixed values, known as variables. Algebra covers a variety of topics, including:

- Basic Algebra: Involves operations and the manipulation of variables and constants.
- Polynomials: Expressions involving variables and exponents.
- Equations and Inequalities: Solving for unknowns, working with equalities and
  inequalities.
- Functions: Mapping of inputs to outputs, examining different types of functions like 
  linear, quadratic, etc.

Algebra is used in various fields, from science and engineering to economics and everyday problem-solving. It's a foundational tool that helps us understand and describe patterns, relationships, and changes in the world around us.
