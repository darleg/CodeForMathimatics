Let's dive into the basics of algebra! Algebra is all about working with variables and constants to solve equations. Here are some foundational concepts:

1. Variables and Constants
- Variables: Symbols (like 𝑥 or 𝑦) that represent unknown values.
- Constants: Fixed values (like 3, 5, or -2) that do not change.
2. Algebraic Expressions
- Combinations of variables, constants, and operations (addition, subtraction, 
  multiplication, and division).

Example: 2𝑥+3 or 4𝑦−7

3. Equations
An equation states that two expressions are equal.

Example: 
2
𝑥
+
3
=
7

The goal is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true.
