Let's dive into the basics of algebra! Algebra is all about working with variables and constants to solve equations. Here are some foundational concepts:

1. Variables and Constants
- Variables: Symbols (like 𝑥 or 𝑦) that represent unknown values.
- Constants: Fixed values (like 3, 5, or -2) that do not change.
2. Algebraic Expressions
- Combinations of variables, constants, and operations (addition, subtraction, 
  multiplication, and division).
- Example: 2𝑥+3 or 4𝑦−7

3. Equations
- An equation states that two expressions are equal.
- Example: 2𝑥+3=7
- The goal is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

4. Solving Equations
- Linear Equations: Equations of the first degree (the highest power of the variable is 1).
- Example: 2𝑥+3=7
  1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2𝑥=4
  2. Divide both sides by 2: 𝑥=2
5. Basic Operations
- Addition and Subtraction: Combining like terms.
  - Example: 3𝑥+2𝑥=5𝑥
- Multiplication: Distributive property.
  - Example: 3(𝑥+2)=3𝑥+6
- Division: Isolating the variable.
  - Example: 𝑥4=2 becomes 𝑥=8
