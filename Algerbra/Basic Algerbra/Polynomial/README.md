# Polynomials

A polynomial is an algebraic expression that consists of variables and coefficients, involving operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. Polynomials are an essential part of algebra and mathematics in general.
## Structure of Polynomials
- A polynomial can be represented in the form: $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + 
a_0$ where:

- 𝑎𝑛,𝑎𝑛−1,...,𝑎1,𝑎0 are coefficients (real numbers).
- 𝑥 is the variable.
-𝑛 is a non-negative integer, representing the degree of the polynomial.
## Types of Polynomials
- Monomial: A polynomial with only one term (3𝑥2).
- Binomial: A polynomial with two terms (𝑥2+3𝑥).
- Trinomial: A polynomial with three terms (𝑥2+3𝑥+2).
## Operations with Polynomials
1. Addition/Subtraction: Combine like terms.
- Example: (2𝑥2+3𝑥+1)+(𝑥2−2𝑥+4)=3𝑥2+𝑥+5
2. Multiplication: Use the distributive property (FOIL method for binomials).
- Example: (𝑥+2)(𝑥+3)=𝑥2+5𝑥+6
3. Division: Use long division or synthetic division.
## Factoring Polynomials
Factoring is the process of breaking down a polynomial into simpler polynomials that can be multiplied together to obtain the original polynomial. Common methods include:
- Factoring out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF).
- Factoring by grouping.
- Using special formulas: Such as the difference of squares, sum/difference of cubes.
