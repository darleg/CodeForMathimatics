A polynomial is an algebraic expression that consists of variables and coefficients, involving operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. Polynomials are an essential part of algebra and mathematics in general.

Structure of Polynomials
A polynomial can be represented in the form: $$ a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0 $$ where:

𝑛
 is a non-negative integer, representing the degree of the polynomial.

Types of Polynomials
Monomial: A polynomial with only one term (e.g., 
3
𝑥
2
).

Binomial: A polynomial with two terms (e.g., 
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
).

Trinomial: A polynomial with three terms (e.g., 
𝑥
2
+
3
𝑥
+
2
).
