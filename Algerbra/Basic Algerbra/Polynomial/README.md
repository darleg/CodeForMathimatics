# Polynomials

A polynomial is an algebraic expression that consists of variables and coefficients, involving operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. Polynomials are an essential part of algebra and mathematics in general.

## Structure of Polynomials

- A polynomial can be represented in the form: $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0$ where:

- 𝑎𝑛,𝑎𝑛−1,...,𝑎1,𝑎0 are coefficients (real numbers).
- 𝑥 is the variable.
-𝑛 is a non-negative integer, representing the degree of the polynomial.

## Types of Polynomials
- Monomial: A polynomial with only one term (e.g., 3𝑥2).
- Binomial: A polynomial with two terms (e.g., 𝑥2+3𝑥).
- Trinomial: A polynomial with three terms (e.g., 𝑥2+3𝑥+2).
