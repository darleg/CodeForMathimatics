Quadratic equations are a fundamental part of algebra. They are polynomial equations of the second degree, meaning the highest power of the variable is 2. The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

𝑎
𝑥
2
+
𝑏
𝑥
+
𝑐
=
0
where:

𝑎
,
𝑏
,
 and 
𝑐
 are constants with 
𝑎
≠
0
.

𝑥
 is the variable we are solving for.
