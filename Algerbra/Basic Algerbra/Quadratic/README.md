# Quadratic equation

Quadratic equations are a fundamental part of algebra. They are polynomial equations of the second degree, meaning the highest power of the variable is 2. The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

$$
𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0
$$

where:

- 𝑎,𝑏, and 𝑐 are constants with $𝑎 ≠ 0$.
- 𝑥 is the variable we are solving for.

## Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations
1. Factoring:
- Find two numbers that multiply to 𝑎𝑐 and add to 𝑏.
2. Rewrite the middle term using these numbers and factor by grouping.
- Example: $$ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 $$ $$(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$$ So, $𝑥=−2$ or $𝑥=−3$
