# Quadratic equation

Quadratic equations are a fundamental part of algebra. They are polynomial equations of the second degree, meaning the highest power of the variable is 2. The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

$$
𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0
$$

where:

- 𝑎,𝑏, and 𝑐 are constants with $𝑎 ≠ 0$.
- 𝑥 is the variable we are solving for.

## Methods to Solve Quadratic Equations
1. Factoring:
- Find two numbers that multiply to 𝑎𝑐 and add to 𝑏.
- Rewrite the middle term using these numbers and factor by grouping.
- Example:

  $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$

  $(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$
  
  So, $𝑥=−2$ or $𝑥=−3$

2. Quadratic Formula:
- Use the formula: $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$           
- This formula always works, even when factoring is difficult or impossible.
- Example: For 2𝑥2+4𝑥−6=0:

  $x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6)}}{2 \cdot 2}$

  $x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 48}}{4}$

  $x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{64}}{4}$

  $x = \frac{-4 \pm 8}{4}$

  $x = 1 \text{ or } x = -3$

3. Completing the Square:
- Rearrange the equation to isolate the quadratic and linear terms on one side.
- Complete the square and solve for 𝑥.
- Example:

  $$x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0$$
  
  $$x^2 + 6x = -8$$
  
  $$x^2 + 6x + 9 = 1$$
  
  $$(x + 3)^2 = 1$$
  
  $$x + 3 = \pm 1$$
  
  $$x = -2 \text{ or } x = -4$$
