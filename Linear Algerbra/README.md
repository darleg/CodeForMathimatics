# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra, on the other hand, is a more specialized area within the broader field of algebra. It focuses on vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces. Key concepts in linear algebra include:

- Vectors: Objects that have both a magnitude and a direction.

- Matrices: Rectangular arrays of numbers that represent linear transformations.

- Systems of Linear Equations: Solving for multiple variables using equations.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Special numbers and vectors associated with matrices that provide insights into their properties.

Applications: Used extensively in areas such as computer science, physics, engineering, and more.
