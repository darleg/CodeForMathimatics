# Calculators
So, in the 70s and 80 I used Basic as my go to computer language to do something quick and dirty. These days I use Python as my go to language. Most of the time I do not even think of it as a powerful Object-oriented programming language with massive amounts of libraries. Python is one of the easiest program languages to get started in. One of the reasons is that you do not even have to declare what kind of variables the program is using. As an old timer Fortran programmer, I had second thoughts about this. However, it was quickly realized that you could concentrate on the subject matter.
