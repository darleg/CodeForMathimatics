# Code For Mathimatics
Most small programs that I have written usually have mathematics at the heart of it. That said, well it is the part that I spend the most time on.  If one can learns enough math and then is able to use it in some of their daily work. It is a good thing.  I consider myself blessed, for I have had several jobs that allowed me to use mathematics on a regular basis.  Whether, testing a navigational computer flying across the country or try to determine what the mean time failure rate of some component requires a bit of mathematics. After writing many of these application programs to resolving problems which I call code for applications just like for mathematic applications.  So, this is more about putting mathematics itself to code than applications code. Hoping that the result will help someone to be able to apply code for mathematics to code any applications requiring mathematics.
