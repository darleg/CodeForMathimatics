# Code For Mathimatics

Most small programs are built on a foundation of mathematics, and itâ€™s the aspect I spend most of my time on. Having the ability to apply mathematics in daily work is invaluable. I consider myself fortunate to have had several jobs where I regularly used math. Whether it was testing a navigational computer during a cross-country flight or determining the mean time to failure rate of a component, mathematics was essential. Over the years, I've written numerous application programs to solve various problems, which I consider coding for mathematical applications. This process is more about translating mathematical concepts into code than just creating application code. My hope is that these efforts will enable others to apply mathematical coding to any application that requires it.
